## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [ x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [ x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[Old code of mine,
Stack Overflow,
Github,
Reddit,
Visual Studio Code

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[One major challenge that I faced in creating this submission was the time constraint. 
I was informed about this opportunity on the last day of application acceptance, about 15 hours prior to the deadline. 
I've had experiences programming prior to this, but I never completed anything quite so large in such a small span of time. I had two lectures to participate in as well, one of which I have an
exam in tommorrow.
Pairing the time constraint with my low level of comfort with HTML,CSS, and JavaScript, this project proved to be really difficult for me to showcase my knowledge in.
That being said, I actually really enjoyed being challenged on this project. Though I didn't deal with many bugs because a large part of the source code was provided to me,
I learned a bit about how I might potentially enjoy working as part of a team that I can contribute to where its needed, and have them
have my back in development the same way so that we can crush our deadines.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[After completing this submission, it's been hard to feel that I haven't been limited in the way that I've exposed myself to web development
I realize now that if I were to challenge myself like this every single day that I could become a significantly better programmer.
However, I don't really know what exactly I want my tech stack to look like yet because I haven't gotten enough exposure yet, and I'm not sure
what exactly I'm capable of taking on.
So the one question that I have about web development is...what should I build next?


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had more time to work on this project, I'd certainly add more visually pleasing css rules just to make the page a bit easier on the eyes. 
Next, I'd create a helper function that decreases the available time that the user has for input as the user gets into the latter stages of 
the game.
A bit further in the future I'd create a button to switch to
different game modes, particularly a competitive game mode with distinct user profiles so that pairs could play against one another
to determine who could remember the most patterns before incorrectly selecting one.]
